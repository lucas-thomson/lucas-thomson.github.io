        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
As a teenager, I began encountering wisps of the Scottish forest, revered and respected in our Celtic culture. Now, I facilitate group and individual revelation, working with the subtle frequencies within land and body.


My great passion lies in assisting others to access the bliss behind our fears. This requires tenderness, patience, loving presence and permission to feel it all. It demands of us an inwards leaning in to contraction, before the ecstasy of our core is revealed. 


As a former diver representing Great Britain, IÃ•ve worked intimately with fear in the body and its transcendence. Years of international competition and training has imparted valuable learnings. Deep presence and mindfulness was the gateway to exceptional dives and I learnt the path that leads to such spiritual exhaulted states. 


Yet one of my greatest teacher has been the land itself. Approaching it with innocent curiosity and childlike wonder allows for the veils to thin and revelations to unfurl. My work includes a transmission of what it means to meet land/body with respect and attunement, allowing for mutual exchange: your energy replenishing the earth while personal revelations unveil. </p>
